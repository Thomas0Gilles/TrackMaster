    arbitrary behind-the-scenes dynamics. An environment can be

    The main API methods that users of this class need to know are:

        step
        reset
        render
        close
        seed

    And set the following attributes:

        action_space: The Space object corresponding to valid actions
        observation_space: The Space object corresponding to valid observations
        reward_range: A tuple corresponding to the min and max possible rewards

    Note: a default reward range set to [-inf,+inf] already exists. Set it if you want a narrower range.

    The methods are accessed publicly as "step", "reset", etc.. The
    non-underscored versions are wrapper methods to which we may add
    functionality over time.

        - rgb_array: Return an numpy.ndarray with shape (x, y, 3),
          representing RGB values for an x-by-y pixel image, suitable
          for turning into a video.

          and ANSI escape sequences (e.g. for colors).
